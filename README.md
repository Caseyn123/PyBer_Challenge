## Overview of Analysis 
The main purpose of this analysis was to use our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by the city type. The three cities were Rural, Suburban, and Urban. With that data we then created a multi-line graph that showed the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102333975/166171594-f75f2f3e-b307-4fb0-a02f-4d92af202fa6.png)
As we can see from this image it shows that fares for Urban areas are much higher then fares for Rural and Suburban. However Urban, Suburban, and Rural fares take a dramatic downward plunge during May of 2019. 

## Summary
There is a clear higher rate of fares for Urban vs the Rural or Suburban city types, this could be because Urban is described as the city which means that there is a much higher demand for ride-shares because there is limited parking in Urban areas. Something we could do to address the disparities between urban ride-share pricing vs suburban and rural is remind people how hard and expensive it can be to find parking downtown. A second recommendation for addressing this disparity is remind people how there are typically higher crime rates in Urban areas which makes people want to do ride-share more and pay that extra fare instead of paying to replace their car incase it gets broken into. A third recommendation we can make for addressing the disparity is that most drivers live in suburban or rural areas compared to the city, therefore they have to go out of their way to drive into the city and get customers from downtown back home which is typically again in suburban or rural areas.
